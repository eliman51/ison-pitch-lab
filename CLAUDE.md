# Ison Pitch Lab

Eli's own free real-time voice pitch app for learning to sing, built to replace the paid Pitch
app (Coda Labs) and to practice Orthodox chant. He plans to keep building it long term.

Eli is not a programmer. Explain changes in plain words, tell him what to try on his phone,
and walk him through any GitHub step one tap at a time. Never use em dashes in anything
written for him.

## Where the app lives

- **The real app is this repository's `index.html`, served by GitHub Pages** at
  https://eliman51.github.io/ison-pitch-lab . Eli saved that link to his phone's home screen.
  Pushing to `main` updates it (give Pages a minute or two). `sw.js` caches the app so it opens
  offline; bump `CACHE` in `sw.js` when a change must reach phones that are offline-first.
- **Claude artifact copy** (secondary): slug `655d6f80-fa5f-4f8c-a69d-50d7c5e337d4`
  (https://claude.ai/artifact/DWz83P6dcQQaiUpjZ8KrfM). Same page with the artifact's own
  `<head>`. `python3 tools/artifact.py` builds it into `dist/artifact/`; publish with the
  Artifact tools (`publish_files`, slug + base_version, files index.html and the three mp3s).
  An older copy, slug `fe7c326a-...` (Nov 2), is out of date; ignore it.
- This repository is **public** (GitHub Pages on a free account needs that). Nothing private
  goes in it: no keys, no personal data.

## Files

- `index.html` the whole app, one page (about 8,000 lines). Search it; do not read it whole.
- `psalm23.mp3`, `psalm23-tone4.mp3`, `chant-forever.mp3` recordings built into the app.
- `p23.bin`, `bzm.bin` data the page loads (`PRIV` in index.html).
- `sw.js` offline cache. `tools/check.py` must say OK before every push.
- `tools/lexicon.mjs` rebuilds the syllable word list inside index.html (not needed for normal changes).

## What Eli wants from it (keep these in mind for every change)

- A beginner learning to sing. Gamified beginner lesson plan with timed sessions (2 to 30
  min); a roughly 6-month path from beginner to simple melodies. He works the first few stages
  for weeks before expanding.
- **Ears-only practice**: most practice happens in his loud shop with headphones, unable to
  look at the phone. Anything that needs eyes on the screen is useless there.
- Goal song: Psalm 23 "Mshiho Natareh L Idtokh" (Tone 3), sung with extreme precision within
  about a year, starting with the opening. Also Psalm 23 Tone 4 (mostly in Loop a part),
  Psalm 91/121 (Tone 7), especially its "hallelujah", sung exactly like the singer, and
  memorizing Psalm 118 octave by octave, later as a very long all-day song.
- He has the singer's permission to use the Psalm 23 recordings (Tone 3 and Tone 4). Keep them
  built in and unlocked, no passwords.
- His voice is lower than the Psalm 23 singer's: songs need a lower-key option.
- Sung words in English, ideally from published sheet music; any Eastern Orthodox English
  source is fine. Chants worked in Western notation; Byzantine scales are loved and practiced
  alongside the fundamentals, with real documented melodies for ears-only drills.
- **Song Maker** (the Chant tab, was "Chant Maker"): paste any words, pick a melody, and every
  syllable is laid on its note. It plays at once as a tone with karaoke words; a voice (the
  Kokoro computer voice or his own recorded reading, re-tuned onto the notes) is optional.
  His real use: Psalm 118 (Orthodox Study Bible wording, which he has permission to use and is
  lightly changing), almost memorized, sung as one very long song while he works, mostly by
  looping parts. He likes the Arabian (Hijaz, Plagal Second) sound, a steady rhythm, real
  Orthodox melodies where possible, and being able to edit and fine tune. A melody's breath
  may fall in the middle of a sentence or even a word; he said that is fine. Total quality; the
  aim is to help people who do not know how to turn psalms into songs.
- Look: the Sketchbook (notebook) design from his Shop Board.
- He has asked about putting it on the Apple App Store.

## How the Song Maker works (search index.html for these names)

- `chText` / `sgWord`: words to syllables with accents. Spelling rules (`chWordSyl`,
  `chWordStress`) plus `SG_LEX`, the list of words the rules get wrong, built from the CMU
  Pronouncing Dictionary by `node tools/lexicon.mjs <data folder>` (see the top of that file).
  Run it again if the rules change. `SG_LITS` holds church-English overrides (bless-ed).
- `SG_MEL`: the melodies, in a small text notation explained above `sgParse`. "Byzantine,
  traditional" entries were read note by note from published scores (Neanes example scores and
  ilizol's neanes-examples, MIT); never add a "traditional" melody from memory. `sgGen` writes
  new melodies from a number.
- `sgAlign`: lays the syllables on the melody's seats (accents on strong seats, slurs, shared
  notes, upbeats, breaths). `sgPlan` turns that into notes and times; `sgTone` is the tone.
- A long song is loaded into the player a few minutes at a time (`sgWin`, `SG_PAGE`).
- A real singing voice comes from outside the app: `sgScore` + `sgMidi` write the song as a MIDI file with lyrics
  (whole word on its first note, `+` for the word's next syllable, `-` for a held syllable; OpenUtau and
  Synthesizer V both read this), and `sgSungIn` / `sgSungLoad` / `sgSungLay` bring the finished recording back as the
  voice (source `sung`, or `s:<id>` when saved with a chant), lined up by `sgSungAlign`.

## The singing voice (researched November 2026)

Eli finds the Kokoro voice bent onto the notes "distractingly bad". What was found:

- Exact notes and words, best sound: Synthesizer V Studio 2 Pro (about $99 once, Mac, voice ASTERIAN is a bass
  from a trained oktavist). No command line; one manual step per song. Its voice licences have no religious clause.
- Free: OpenUtau with a DiffSinger voice (TIGER is male, personal use only, no re-hosting). Many DiffSinger voices
  forbid religious use (Miyo, Laru Mine); read the terms of any voice before using it. No voice files may go in
  this public repository.
- SoulX-Singer (Apache 2.0) sings MIDI plus lyrics in a voice copied from a short recording, and runs on an Apple
  Silicon Mac. It could sing in Eli's own voice.
- Suno "Cover" sounds the most lifelike but only follows the melody roughly, so it is not for exact practice.
- Nothing good runs on the iPhone or inside a web page yet. A DiffSinger voice could in principle run in the page
  with onnxruntime-web (acoustic model plus vocoder, fed our own phonemes, timings and pitch), loaded from a file
  the user picks; expect it to be slow on a phone.

## Every change

1. Edit `index.html` (or the other files).
2. `python3 tools/check.py` must say OK.
3. Commit with a plain message and push to `main`. Tell Eli what changed and what to try.
4. Only if Eli wants the artifact copy current: `python3 tools/artifact.py` and publish it.
